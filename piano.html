              Actually, many people with small hands play piano, I've known people who have small hands, but have their master's in music, and are amazing at piano. Here's a good test, stretch your hands out, and now try playing from C with your thumb, to the C above with your pinky finger. If you can reach that, or almost reach that, your hands are big enough to play most things. If you pass that test you're set! Even if you don't pass, there are still pieces you can play for smaller hands. You shouldn't let that hold you back from your dreams!

              Harmonic minor scales and melodic minor scales differ in the pattern of how the notes are played. The harmonic minor scale follows the steps as: whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole + half, and half. The melodic minor scale follows the pattern of a whole step, then half step, four whole steps, and then a half step.

              Yes, and no, you don't really have to do anything, you could just play by ear, but that's much less reliable. 
              My personal answer is you should learn how to read notes. It would be like someone asking,
               “Hey, do you think I need to learn how to read words so that I can read a story from a book? Or can I just listen to someone else read the story for me,
                and then I'll try to recite the story word for word and commit it to memory!” Which do you find to be more practical? The thing is, 
                it doesn't actually take very long to read music, I once had an adult student from Russia named Valeria who started piano when she was 29, 
                who never took a piano lesson in her life, but always wanted to learn. In 2 weeks of study, she could read notes quite quickly,
                and she was reading the notes for an easy piano version of Fur Elise. In one month she could play the whole thing! 
                You know what her secret was? She just wanted to learn badly. She got flash cards and studied. My point is, 
                you can learn your notes as fast as she did if you just decide you want to. It's possible to learn how to read in less than a month, 
                and its worth that if it means you don't have to suffer through it for the rest of your life right? So, get out there and start learning your notes!

              Ahhh, this is a very popular question that I get asked A LOT. My suggestion is, do you have money? Do you have space? 
              Are you pretty serious? If you answered yes to these questions, buy a piano. If you don't have much space, or you're short on cash,
               go for the keyboard, but don't go too cheap, because a very cheap keyboard won't be worth it in the long run. You could also get a keyboard you're just testing the
                waters and you want to see how you like it first. Having a great instrument is important if you're buying it for yourself or child, playing on some crappy 
                thing will make practice and performances dull, so please buy the best you can afford within your budget.

              Pain and stiffness are a pretty common problem. I've heard that there has been great success with the "Alexander Technique" but I cannot personally confirm this myself. 
              There is also another article targeted more towards pianists at pianomap.com. Besides those resources here are some quick concepts that can be applied to hopefully 
              help reduce your pain.

              It depends on the piano. Each note has three strings in the treble, two strings in the tenor and part of the bass, and only one in the very low bass. One of ours has 65 trebles (X 3=195), 12 tenor/bass (X 2=24), 
              and 11 single low bass, so it comes out to 230. But that's a large grand, so you need to look in your piano and count them up.

              The left (soft) pedal works differently on grands and uprights.  On an upright or 'vertical' piano--this includes spinets, consoles, studio uprights and large uprights--the soft pedal 
              operates a bar inside that pushes all the hammers closer to the strings, which makes it easier to play softer.  You can watch this by opening the top of the piano and looking down inside 
              while you work the pedal. A grand is more complicated: the soft pedal slides the whole action--keys and all--over to the right a little bit so that the hammers only hit two of the three strings 
              that are assigned to each note (only two in the bass, and if you go down far enough there's only one).  This not only makes the sound softer, but changes the tone somewhat as well, because you're 
              striking those two (or one) strings with a different part of the hammer.  If you have a grand, work the soft pedal and watch how the whole keyboard shifts back and forth.

              There are two basic types: Grand pianos have their strings and soundboard parallel to the floor, and Verticals (or Uprights) have their strings and soundboard turned up perpendicular to the floor.
               Both kinds come in different sizes and styles. Grands can be anywhere from 4 and a half to 9 and a half feet long.
               Uprights can be 52 or more inches high; around 45 inches ("studio uprights"); about 40-42 inches ("consoles"); and as low as 36-38 inches ("spinets").

              No, but you limit yourself if you don’t. The ability to read music opens out an entirely new range of possibilities to you. 
              It gives you a universal language to understand and communicate music, fast and accurately. This then gives you access to an almost unlimited range of music that, 
              once you get good enough, you will be able to play as soon as you see it.
